# **3D First-Person Movement Prototype**

Welcome to the **3D First-Person Movement Prototype**! This project is a demonstration of first-person movement and camera controls in a 3D environment using **React Three Fiber**, **Rapier Physics**, and **Three.js**. It includes features like walking, looking around, interacting with objects, and teleporting to specific locations.

---

## **Features**

- **Interactive Props**: Click on objects to interact with them and view descriptions.
- **Teleportation**: Teleport to specific locations near props or return to the starting position.
- **Dynamic Settings**: Adjust camera rotation speed and player walk speed in real-time.

---

## **Demo**
Check out the live demo of the project [here](https://cova-bonica-test.netlify.app/).

## **Features**

- ### **First-Person Movement and Camera**
Move around the environment using `WASD` or arrow keys.

Look around by holding the right mouse button.
