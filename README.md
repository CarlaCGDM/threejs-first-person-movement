# **3D First-Person Movement Prototype**

Welcome to the **3D First-Person Movement Prototype**! This project is a demonstration of first-person movement and camera controls in a 3D environment using **React Three Fiber**, **Rapier Physics**, and **Three.js**. It includes features like walking, looking around, interacting with objects, and teleporting to specific locations.

---

## **Features**
- **First-Person Movement**: Move around the environment using `WASD` or arrow keys.
- **Camera Controls**: Look around by holding the right mouse button.
- **Physics-Based Collisions**: Realistic collisions with walls, slopes, and other objects.
- **Interactive Props**: Click on objects to interact with them and view descriptions.
- **Teleportation**: Teleport to specific locations near props or return to the starting position.
- **Dynamic Settings**: Adjust camera rotation speed and player walk speed in real-time.

## **Technically Challenging Features**

This project includes several advanced features that required creative problem-solving and deep integration of React, Three.js, and physics engines. Here are the most challenging aspects:

---

### **1. Custom First-Person Camera Controls**
- Implemented smooth, responsive camera rotation using mouse movement deltas.
- Added pitch and yaw clamping to prevent camera flipping.
- Integrated with the `pointerlock` API for a seamless first-person experience.
- Applied damping and smoothing to eliminate jitter during rotation.

---

### **2. Physics-Based Player Movement**
- Integrated `@react-three/rapier` for realistic physics-based movement.
- Implemented custom keyboard controls for player movement (WASD) and jumping.
- Added collision detection and grounded checks to prevent double jumps.
- Synchronized physics updates with the rendering loop for smooth gameplay.

---

### **3. Dynamic Prop System**
- Created a reusable `Prop` component for interactive 3D objects.
- Added hover and click interactions with material highlighting.
- Implemented teleportation logic to move the player to specific prop locations.
- Used `useGLTF` and `Suspense` for efficient model loading and rendering.

---

### **4. Environment Optimization**
- Added a toggle for switching between high-resolution and standard-resolution environments.
- Memoized environment models to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
- Preloaded models to reduce delays when toggling between resolutions.

---

### **5. Performance Optimization**
- Used `useMemo` and `React.memo` to optimize rendering performance.
- Implemented lazy loading for large 3D models to reduce initial load times.
- Added a performance monitor using the `Stats` component from `@react-three/drei`.

---

### **6. Settings and UI Integration**
- Created a centralized `SettingsContext` for managing global settings (e.g., player speed, camera sensitivity).
- Built a dynamic settings panel with sliders and toggles for real-time adjustments.
- Integrated the UI overlay with the 3D scene using `Html` from `@react-three/drei`.

---

### **7. Debugging and Profiling**
- Used the browserâ€™s **Performance** tab to identify and resolve bottlenecks.
- Added debug logs and visual aids (e.g., wireframes, collider visualizations) to troubleshoot issues.
- Tested and optimized the project across multiple devices and browsers.
